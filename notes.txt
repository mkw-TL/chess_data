How to edit:

Content/English _index.Rmd is the main page
Gets compiled by blogdown into .md (blogdown::build_site())
Okay that seems to be broken, use knitr::knit("content/english/_index.Rmd instead -- make sure it goes to the correct output directory!)
gets put into public
Hugo shows the .md file. 
'hugo server' makes it show the webpage
netlify deploy --prod
