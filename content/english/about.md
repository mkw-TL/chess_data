I am a person who thinks about things sometimes. I am a singer, having made it to a national choir, and have had some vocal training. My Recital can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/Nb5KCROQ1A0" target="_blank">here</a>. I 3d model <a href="https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/User:TL" target="_blank">(link)</a>, play table tennis, have back pain, read textbooks, and vigerously advocate that R is the best programing language ever (if it didn't start at 1). 

My highest (and as of writing on Sept 2, 2023, current) rapid rating on chess.com is 1903, which is pretty cool.
