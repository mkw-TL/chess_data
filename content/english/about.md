I am a person who thinks about things sometimes. I am a singer, having made it to a national choir, and have had some vocal training. My Recital can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/Nb5KCROQ1A0" target="_blank">here</a>. I 3d model <a href="https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/User:TL" target="_blank">(link)</a>, play table tennis, have back pain, read textbooks, and vigerously advocate that R is the best programing language ever (if it didn't start at 1).

Oh! And I'm also a 2nd degree black belt in American Freestyle Karate, which is cool
