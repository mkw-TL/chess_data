```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(webshot)
```

Here is a shiny app, that would show on my Windows configuration (after a weeks worth of troubleshooting), however, it seems there are OpenSSL configuration difficulties in Linux. 
Shiny in a Rmd file, rendered via PhantomJS does seem circuitous, and I am inclined to use a technology such as d3.js for future web visualization projects. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_app("https://mkw-tl.shinyapps.io/shiny/",
  height = "600px")
